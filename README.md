## Michelle Katz, Jessica Wallen, Kasey Nelson, Keith Nelson, Matt Halom

When running/testing:
Please build from TestingDatabase.xcworkspace (not TestingDatabse.xcodeproj) and run the app on the iPhone 11 Pro.

About our app:
Our app, SafeConnect, is desigend to allow people to meet others with similar interest and go to events with them while staying COVID safe. To use the app, log in with a Google account by clicking on the Sign In with Google button. You will be taken to the event feed where you can explore events that sound interesting to you, and you can click to find out more information such as the time, location, and the COVID-19 saftey precautions. You can also add the event to your calendar. You can click the "Add a New Event" button to add an event. In the connections feed, you can find people and click to find their contact information and their description that is essentially the "About Me" section. In the connections feed, you have the ability to sort the connections listed by various fields. In the "My Profile" tab, you can see your profile and edit it to add more information about you.

Side note: This app is called TestingDatabase because originally it was just supposed to be for testing our database's functionality, but we ended up moving our whole app's functionality here and were not able to change the name of the project.
