About our app:
Our app, SafeConnect, is desigend to allow people to meet others with similar interest and go to events with them while staying COVID safe. To use the app, log in with a google account when you open the app. You will be taken to the event feed where you can explore events that sound interesting to you, and you can click to find out more information such as the time, location, and the COVID-19 saftey precautions. You can also add the event to your calendar. You can click the plus button to add an event. In the connections feed, you can find people and click to find their contact information and their description that is essentially the "About Me" section. In the "My Profile" tab, you can see your profile and edit it to add more information about you.
